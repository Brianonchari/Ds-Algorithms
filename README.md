## Intro
Data structures and algorithms are essential in writing effecient code and also in designing good software.The goal
of this repository is to document my learnings and implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Java.

## Data Structures
Data structures are a means of organizing and storing data in a computer so a to make it effective to perfom operations on the stored data.
#### Why data structures?
- help manage and organize data.
- clean and understandable code.
- essential in creating fast and powerful algorithms.

## Algorithms

## Plugins
- [Git Code Format Maven Plugin](https://github.com/Cosium/git-code-format-maven-plugin) A maven plugin that automatically deploys
  [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) code formatter as a `pre-commit` git hook.
